**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering architecture using the IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset. The architecture leverages Amazon S3 for data storage, Apache Spark for data processing, and Databricks for data transformation, SQL analytics, and visualization. The primary objective is to ingest, process, and analyze IPL data to derive meaningful insights and create visual reports.

*Architecture*

Components
IPL Data Set: The raw dataset containing information about IPL matches, players, scores, and other relevant statistics.

Amazon S3: A scalable and reliable storage service used for storing the raw IPL dataset.

Databricks: An integrated data analytics platform used for data processing, analytics, and visualization. It provides a collaborative environment for data engineers and analysts.

*Data Flow*

Data Ingestion: The IPL dataset is uploaded to Amazon S3.
Data Storage: The ingested data is stored in Amazon S3.
Data Processing:
Databricks accesses the data from Amazon S3.
Transformation: Apache Spark within Databricks is used to clean, transform, and enrich the data.
SQL Analytics: Processed data is queried using Spark SQL for deeper analysis.
Visualization: Results are visualized using Databricks' built-in visualization tools to create dashboards and reports.

*Benefits*
Scalability: Both Amazon S3 and Databricks can handle large datasets efficiently.
Performance: Apache Sparkâ€™s in-memory processing capabilities significantly improve data processing speed.
Collaboration: Databricks provides a collaborative environment for various stakeholders to work together.
Integration: Seamless integration between storage, processing, and analytics provides a streamlined workflow.
